                previously used to distinguish  distributed computing by PCs from the monolithic, centralized computing model used by mainframes.
               today computer transactions in which the server fulfills a request made by a client are very common. The client server model has become one of the central
               ideas of the client establishes a connection to the server over a LAN or WAN such as the internet.</p>

                     correct designation using the IP address of the device with which it wishes to communicate. At times, hosts use hostname instead of IP addresses
                    to communicate over the network in which case the DNS will convert the hostname to an IP address.</p>
