    <p>A paragraph is a series of sentences that<br> are organized and coherent, and are all related to a single topic.
         Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. 
         <br>This is because paragraphs show a reader where the subdivisions of an essay begin and end,
          and thus help the reader<br>see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points</p>
